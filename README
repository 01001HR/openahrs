openIMU - open source IMU

-------------------------

1. Requirements
---------------
openIMU uses the Eigen2 library, under the GPL license too.
You can download Eigen2 from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

You need to modify the EIGENPATH variable inside Makefile.paths before trying to
compile anything.


2. Code organization
--------------------

Directories:
	
	openIMU:
		The folder openIMU contains main source code, built as a library to openIMU.a
To make the library just type 'make' in this same directory.
		!!BEWARE!!: read the above section since the Eigen2 path needs to be configured
first.

	tests:
		Contains several tests. The Kalman ones simulate noisy input signals and write
the results to an octave-compatible file. If octave is available on the host machine
the data can be plotted by executing the script plot_data.m from octave.
		To build the examples just go to the right example directory and type 'make'.
You can also build the examples by issuing 'make test-xxxx' on the root directory,
where 'xxxx' depends on the sample to be built (type 'make help' for a description).
