-------------------------

1. Requirements
---------------
openAHRS uses the Eigen2 library, under the GPL license too.
You can download Eigen2 from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

You need to modify the EIGENPATH variable inside Makefile.paths before trying to
compile anything.

Use the GCC_PREFIX macro in Makefile to specify which compiler to use.

To use the util/plotter utility you need the qwt library (http://qwt.sf.net)

2. Code organization
--------------------

Directories:
	
	- openAHRS:
		The folder openAHRS contains main source code, built as a library to openAHRS.a
To make the library just type 'make' in this same directory.
		!!BEWARE!!: read the above section since the Eigen2 path needs to be configured
first.

	- tests:
		Contains several tests. The Kalman ones simulate noisy input signals and write
the results to an octave-compatible file. If octave is available on the host machine
the data can be plotted by executing the script plot_data.m from octave.
		To build the examples just go to the right example directory and type 'make'.
You can also build the examples by issuing 'make test-xxxx' on the root directory,
where 'xxxx' depends on the sample to be built (type 'make help' for a description).

	- AHRSs:
		AHRS implementations. Currently there is only an AVR32 port.
		Make sure the GCC_PREFIX macro in the main Makefile is correctly set.

	- util/plotter
		 Utility to plot values received through UDP from AHRS. Uses the qwt library. Also draws an opengl scene with current position (might be CPU-intensive on some cases).
